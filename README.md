# Water-Energy-Costs-Emissions-Optimizations
Different optimization problems (linear, fuzzy, dynamic, goal-programming, and non-linear models), with indicative input number values. The models consider the water allocation from different sources to different uses, renewable and non-renewable energy demands and supplies, with their associated carbon emissions and costs.
